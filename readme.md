# Assessments

There are two assessments.

## 1. Assessment 1

This one has Two tabs that are currently not working. Please make them work when we switch the tabs.

Expected: Tab 1 and Tab 2 can be switched interchangeably.

## 2. Assessment 2

There is a bug in this code causing the count to keep on running, please fix it.

Expected: The counter is initially at 5. Clicking the buttons increment/decrement by 5.
